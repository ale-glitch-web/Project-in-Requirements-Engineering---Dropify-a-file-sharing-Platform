# Dropify – Requirements Engineering Project

A collaborative academic project developed in the **Requirements Engineering** module  
- FHNW – BSc Business Information Technology  
- Group Work | Fall Semester 2023  

---

## Project Summary

**Dropify** is a conceptual cloud-based web platform designed to empower FHNW students in the Business Information Technology program by facilitating the **sharing of study materials** in a secure and collaborative environment.

The platform enables students to:
- Upload and download PDF study documents
- Rate and filter materials
- Request technical support
- Navigate the platform via a clean and responsive GUI
- Benefit from AI-powered quality control for uploaded content

## Requirements Engineering

### Elicitation Techniques

Three techniques were used to gather and refine system requirements:
- **Brainstorming**: Group discussion to define initial features and structure
- **Surveys**: Gathered input from BIT students on needs, frustrations, and desired features
- **Interviews**: Conducted with professors and the Head of BIT to validate requirements and identify technical constraints
